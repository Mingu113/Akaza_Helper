# My GTK program
Side project.  
I made this for fun. Purely Vietnamese. You can translate the text which most is at the top using define.  
This is the project I make for learning GTK and try writing more C code, which kind of ineffective because I use GTK and GLib almost 100%.  
# Why Akaza Akari?
Because she is the best.  
Beside idk which anime girl else to chose.
# Features
Pre-programmed dialogues, get weather information (in working, get information from [Open-meteo.com](https://open-meteo.com/)), timer (work, just there is no notification beside a window that pop up in background).
